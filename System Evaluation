Things to evaluate the system on:
- Weather conditions
- pH sensor accuracy
- Data storage on the Arduino
- Amount of voltage going through the system from the battery
- Maximum distance to communicate with Bluetooth module
- Amount of time the system is on and working
- - Will need to dedicate a day to testing
- Environmental interactions
- - Will any animals/creatures disturb the system?
- - Does the system disturb any animals/creatures?
- Potential overheating issues
- Android versions and compatibility
- Time complexity of sensing algorithm
- Processing time
- Dimensions of Buoy
- Reliability of the physical floatation device
- User acceptance
-- Is the system too bulky?
-- Can it be used in a variety of places?

Current evaluations:
- The system stays afloat, and even when met with running water, will remain stable.
- Weather conditions
- - During partly cloudy weather, the system remains stable. We are able to get readings from the Bluetooth module and there are no disturbances in the water.
- - This system cannot be used while snowing since the snow will fall on top of the system, which isn't fully waterproof
- - The same applies when it's raining, water will enter the system from the top
- pH sensor accuracy
- - +- 0.1
- Maximum distance to communicate with Bluetooth module
- - About 102 feet
- Waterproofness
- - The Tupperware container is set on a piece of Styrofoam connected to the PVC structure, making it so water from the river wonâ€™t disturb the electronics. 
- - The Tupperware container does include 2 small holes to run the pH sensor cable and the wiring from the solar panels, marking a vulnerability in the system in case it were to rain. 
- - The solar panels are attached with zip ties, so in the event of rain or snow, some disturbances could occur to the wiring, including corrosion. 
- Privacy
- - The system can be tampered with, as there are no ways to "lock" the electronics from unwanted visitors including animals and people trying to disturb the system.
- - No way to monitor if the system is being tampered with. 
- - Bluetooth communication can be done with any android phone supporting bluetooth 4.0 and above. 
- Arduino Storage and Complexity
- - Arduino sends data every 10 seconds.
- - Sensing algorithm is O(n^2). 
- - 16070/32256 bytes are used in the program storage space. (49%)
- - 1141/2048 bytes of dynamic memory are used. (55%)
- Android Versions
- - Phone must have Bluetooth 4.0 or above. 
- - Minimum SDK of the app is 19.
- - Target SDK of the app is 29. 
- User Acceptance
- - System must be disassembled when transporting.
- - Lightweight but awkward to carry.
- - The system is smaller than most backpacks
- - L x W x H, 14" x 13" x 8"
- - With its dimensions, it can be used in different bodies of water, such as rivers,
- - lakes, streams, and runoffs due to its compact square size. 
- Environmental interactions
- - Many ducks passed by and deliberately avoided the buoy
- - The buoy got stuck at the river bank
- Potential overheating issues
- - The battery was barely warm after an hour of activity
- Processing time
- - Takes 2-3 seconds to connect to the bluetooth module
- - The reading updates every 10 seconds as we set the arduino to get a value every 10 seconds. 
- - This is because the amount of unnatural spikes in pH occurs more often the more frequent the pH sensor is read
- Amount of voltage going through the system from the battery
- - The voltage readings on the battery indicate that the solar cells are able to keep the battery charged at a consistent level
- - However, the hosting phone lost 15% power in the span of an hour while using the app.
- - This reinforces the idea that users are ideally supposed to check in on the system every so often, not constantly monitor it
