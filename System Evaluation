Things to evaluate the system on:
- Weather conditions
- pH sensor accuracy
- Data storage on the Arduino
- Amount of voltage going through the system from the battery
- Maximum distance to communicate with Bluetooth module
- Illuminance values 
- Amount of time the system is on and working
- - Will need to dedicate a day to testing
- Environmental interactions
- - Will any animals/creatures disturb the system?
- - Does the system disturb any animals/creatures?
- Potential overheating issues

Current evaluations:
- The system stays afloat, and even when met with running water, will remain stable.
- Weather conditions
- - During partly cloudy weather, the system remains stable. We are able to get readings from the Bluetooth module and there are no disturbances in the water.
- - This system cannot be used while snowing since the snow will fall on top of the system, which isn't fully waterproof
- Waterproofness
- - The Tupperware container is set on a piece of Styrofoam connected to the PVC structure, making it so water from the river wonâ€™t disturb the electronics. 
- - The Tupperware container does include 2 small holes to run the pH sensor cable and the wiring from the solar panels, marking a vulnerability in the system in case it were to rain. 
- - The solar panels are attached with zip ties, so in the event of rain or snow, some disturbances could occur to the wiring, including corrosion.
