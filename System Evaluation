Things to evaluate the system on:
- Weather conditions
- pH sensor accuracy
- Data storage on the Arduino
- Amount of voltage going through the system from the battery
- Maximum distance to communicate with Bluetooth module
- Illuminance values 
- Amount of time the system is on and working
- - Will need to dedicate a day to testing
- Environmental interactions
- - Will any animals/creatures disturb the system?
- - Does the system disturb any animals/creatures?
- Potential overheating issues
- Android versions and compatibility
- Time complexity of sensing algorithm
- Processing time
- Dimensions of Buoy
- Reliability of the physical floatation device
- User acceptance
-- Is the system too bulky?
-- Can it be used in a variety of places?

Current evaluations:
- The system stays afloat, and even when met with running water, will remain stable.
- Weather conditions
- - During partly cloudy weather, the system remains stable. We are able to get readings from the Bluetooth module and there are no disturbances in the water.
- - This system cannot be used while snowing since the snow will fall on top of the system, which isn't fully waterproof
- Waterproofness
- - The Tupperware container is set on a piece of Styrofoam connected to the PVC structure, making it so water from the river wonâ€™t disturb the electronics. 
- - The Tupperware container does include 2 small holes to run the pH sensor cable and the wiring from the solar panels, marking a vulnerability in the system in case it were to rain. 
- - The solar panels are attached with zip ties, so in the event of rain or snow, some disturbances could occur to the wiring, including corrosion. 
- Privacy
- - The system can be tampered with, as there are no ways to "lock" the electronics from unwanted visitors including animals and people trying to disturb the system.
- - No way to monitor if the system is being tampered with. 
- - Bluetooth communication can be done with any android phone supporting bluetooth 4.0 and above.
